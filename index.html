    <h3>Learning Java the Hard Way Answers</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>When would you use "=" vs "==" vs "equals"</li>
      <div color = blue>answer: "=" is used to assign a variable with a value while "==" is used to compare objects. "==" could be used as a conditional boolean expression.
       it could be used in for or while loops. Equals method is used to compare strings.</div>
      <li>What is the difference between switch and if/else? when would you use one versus the other?</li>
      <div color = blue>answer: You can implement any switch to if/else statement and vice versa. switches takes a variable and that is compared in cases. while if/else statement you can write all the conditions at once.
      I would prefer using if/else statement but, if the code is understood more clearer by using switch, I would use it.</div>
      <li>What does it mean to 'cast a double to an int'? Give an example of when you would do this and explain what is happening.</li>
      <div color = blue>answer: if the variable type is not the same, it is not possible to save a different type into another. However, casting makes it possible to do so. An example would be implemanting random mathod. Random gives a value double between 0.0 to 0.99999999.
      However we can give an integer between certain interval by multiplying a number and writing (int) infront of the variable that will be assigned.</div>
      <li>What is void in a method declaration? How does this differ from declaring a method with a return type?</li>
      <div color = blue>answer: If there is a return type, by using the method you will be getting a value of the return type. If the return type is void, there is no value that will be returned.</div>
      <li>When it comes to methods, what is the difference between a "parameter" and an "argument"? is there one? When would you use one versus the other?</li>
        <div color = blue>answer: There are no difference when it comes to parameter. There is explicit param and implicit param. explicit is the one that you need to call the method. implicit is an istance variable that is called within method.</div>
